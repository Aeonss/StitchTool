## Features

This program is for anyone wanting to easily and quickly stitch/split images horizontally/vertically,
but is mainly for Webtoons Creators and translation groups
(specifically for raw providers / cleaners and redrawers / quality checkers).

**Stitch Tool** allows you to:
* Stitch together __any__ amount of images either vertically or 
horizontally

* Split an image into __any__ amount of images either vertically or horizontally

* Preview image before splitting, which is shown by a red line in a separate window.
* (Will not show if the image is too large)

* Smart split images by free space, allowing for fast splitting without needing to check if the image
was split through a speech bubble or SFX.

* Stitch and split in one go, with the ability to stitch (horizontally/vertically) and split (horizontally/vertically/smart split)

* Choose a folder of images or just select several images while stitching/splitting

* Add repeatable watermarks to your images

* Autofill the directories you worked in as well as the previous action and options used for a faster work speed

## How To Use (Smart Split)

This feature is specifically used for splitting Webtoons, and splits a long image based on "free space", which is
determined by a row of pixels that have the same color. Therefore, this works on any part of a Webtoon, even if it has
an off-white or black background.

2. Select the input image, and the amount of images you would like it to be split into.

3. (Optional) Select output folder. It defaults to the user's folder.

4. (Optional) Input the image name (Red Textbox). It defaults to "StitchTool-#" when
   splitting.

## How To Use (Watermark)

1. (Optional) Change the opacity percentage and/or greyscale checkbox.

2. Click the "Add Watermark" button.
