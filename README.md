## Features

This program is for Webtoons Creators and translation groups (specifically for raw providers / cleaners and redrawers / quality checkers)
that need to stitch or split multiple images, but works for other purposes as well.

**Stitch Tool** allows you to:
* Stitch together __any__ amount of images either vertically or 
horizontally

* Split an image into __any__ amount of images either vertically or horizontally

* Preview image before splitting, which is shown by a red line in a separate window. 
  (Will not show if the image is too large)

* Smart split images by free space, allowing for fast splitting during speed-runs without needing to check if the image
was split through a speech bubble or SFX.

* Choose a folder of images or just select several images while stitching/splitting

* Add watermarks to your images to discourage other groups from stealing work

## How To Use (Stitch/Split)

1. Choose the action (Purple Radio Buttons) you want to do, e.g. Stitch Vertically.

2. Choose the input images. You can choose an entire folder of images (stitching only), or you can choose specific images.

3. (Optional) Choose output folder. It defaults to the user's folder.

4. (Optional) Input image name (Red Textbox). It defaults to "StitchTool" when stitching, and "StitchTool-#" when
splitting.

5. Click the run button.

## How To Use (Smart Split)

This feature is specifically used for splitting Webtoons, and splits a long image based on "free space", which is
determined by a row of pixels that have the same color. Therefore, this works on any part of a Webtoon, even if it has
an off-white or black background.

1. Choose "Smart Split" (Purple Radio Button)

2. Choose the input image, and the amount of images you would like it to be split into.

3. (Optional) Choose output folder. It defaults to the user's folder.

4. (Optional) Input image name (Red Textbox). It defaults to "StitchTool-#" when
   splitting.

5. Click the run button.

## How To Use (Watermark)

1. (Optional) Choose the opacity percentage and/or greyscale checkbox.

2. Click the "Add Watermark" button.

3. Choose the image to add a watermark on.

4. Choose the watermark image.

5. Choose the amount of times you want the watermark to appear.
